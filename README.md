## Mission to Mars
This project focused on our recently learned knowledge and skills of web scraping and data analysis. It also called on us to further practice our knowledge and core skills: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data and visually communicating what we've learned. In this project, we've used Python libraries, Splinter, Chrome Dev Tools, Webdriver, Beautiful Soup and more. Our goal was to become familiar with web scraping while gathering information about Mars. These included HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

# Analysis Results
The code used for these results can be found in [Mars News](part_1_mars_news.ipynb) and [Mars Weather](part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)
The csv files are saved as [Mars]](mars.csv) [Mars Weather](mars_weather.csv).
